---------------------------------------------
	Component communication
		a. You can pass the data from 1 component to another component
		b. You can pass the functions from 1 component to another component
			Note: React component communicaiton is 1 WAY - from parenet to child only
		C. Since our application can have multi level components, it is prefered to declare a container at the top of 						hirearch which will hold data and function which will flow from top towards bottom

		d. This container is called state container
		e. child will recieve the data and function in form of a props
		f. any change in state will reflect props where ever it is used
		g. You cannot make changes to Props, changes has to come from state
		h. we use setState method to make changes to state
